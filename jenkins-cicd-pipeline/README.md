# README for Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

## Project Overview
This project implements a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins. The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the application, ensuring that code changes are integrated smoothly and efficiently.

## Project Structure
- **Jenkinsfile**: Defines the CI/CD pipeline stages and steps.
- **README.md**: Documentation for the project.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **Dockerfile**: Instructions for building the Docker image for the application.
- **scripts/**: Contains scripts for building, testing, and deploying the application.
  - **build.sh**: Script to build the application.
  - **test.sh**: Script to run tests for the application.
  - **deploy.sh**: Script to handle deployment of the application.
- **ci/**: Contains Groovy code for defining pipeline stages.
  - **pipeline-stages.groovy**: Custom logic for each stage of the Jenkins pipeline.
- **vars/**: Contains reusable functions or variables for the pipeline.
  - **common.groovy**: Common functions or variables for the pipeline.
- **resources/jenkins/**: Configuration settings for Jenkins.
  - **config.yml**: Configuration settings required for the pipeline.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd jenkins-cicd-pipeline
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Docker and Jenkins installed on your machine.

3. **Configure Jenkins**: 
   - Set up Jenkins with the necessary plugins for pipeline support.
   - Configure credentials and environment variables as specified in `resources/jenkins/config.yml`.

4. **Run the Pipeline**: 
   - Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins and point it to the `Jenkinsfile` in this repository.
   - Trigger the pipeline to start the build, test, and deploy process.

## Usage
- Modify the scripts in the `scripts/` directory as needed to fit your application requirements.
- Update the `Dockerfile` to customize the Docker image for your application.
- Adjust the pipeline stages in `ci/pipeline-stages.groovy` to add or modify the CI/CD process.
